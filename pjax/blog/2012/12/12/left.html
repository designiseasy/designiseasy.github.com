<p>Left is a clean, whitespace-happy layout for <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>This is designed to be an easy layout to modify for your own blog. It was
extracted from <a href="http://zachholman.com">zachholman.com</a>, which means it was battle-hardened from
years of posting serious blog posts about emoji and swear words.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re actually reading an example post right now. See how cool it is? Oh, be
quiet, you&rsquo;re making me blush.</p>

<hr />

<p>You&rsquo;ll want to <a href="https://github.com/holman/left#readme">get the code</a> and read the README to learn how to
install and set up Left for your own purposes.</p>
