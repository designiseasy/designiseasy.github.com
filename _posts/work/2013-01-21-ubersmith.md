Ubersmith came to us looking to freshen up their existing website. They've been around for greater than 10 years (an eternity in internet-years) and felt it was time to modernize their website. We helped give them a modern look, as well as re-focus how they approach talking about their product and breaking it into categories based on their target audiences.

Later we also helped start brining the the application interface into the 2000s as well.
