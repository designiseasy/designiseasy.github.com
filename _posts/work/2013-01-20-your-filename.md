Shortly after we finished the Voxel Configurator project, Voxel was purchased by a company called Internap. In order to more closely align their brand with the new parent company, they wanted a refresh of their main site, voxel.net. We expanded upon the style we established with the Configurator project, but brought in colors that were closer to Internaps brand. 

The Voxel brand has since been merged into the Internap brand.
